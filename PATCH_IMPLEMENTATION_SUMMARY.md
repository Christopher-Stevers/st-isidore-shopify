## Differences from Original Patch

1. **No CSV Validation**: Original patch included Meta Ads CSV file. We removed this as it's not needed for the Hydrogen implementation.

2. **Framework Differences**: 
   - Original used generic React/TypeScript structure
   - Adapted to Hydrogen + React Router v7
   - Uses Shopify Hydrogen components (Image, CartForm, etc.)

3. **Simplified Architecture**:
   - No separate Shopify client file (uses Hydrogen's built-in storefront)
   - Metafields fetched directly in route loader
   - Components use Hydrogen's optimized Image component

4. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Added savings percentage calculation
   - Added trust badges section
   - Added responsive grid layouts
   - Added conditional rendering for missing data

## Usage

### Creating a New Offer

1. **Manual Method** (Shopify Admin):
   - Create product with handle: `fall-family-beef-sampler`
   - Add metafields in custom namespace
   - Product auto-available at `/offers/fall-family-beef-sampler`

2. **Script Method**:
   ```bash
   npm run shopify:upsert-offer
   ```

### Required Environment Variables
Already configured in `.env`:
- `PRIVATE_ADMIN_API_TOKEN` (for script)
- `PUBLIC_STORE_DOMAIN`
- `PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN`

## Testing

Test the implementation:
1. Visit `/offers/fall-family-beef-sampler` (after creating product)
2. Verify all metafield data displays correctly
3. Test add to cart functionality
4. Check responsive design on mobile
5. Verify SEO meta tags

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create First Offer** using the script or manually in Shopify

3. **Configure Meta Ads Campaign** pointing to offer URL

4. **Monitor Performance** using Shopify Analytics

## Notes

- All offer pages use the same route pattern (`/offers/$handle`)
- Metafields are optional (components handle missing data gracefully)
- Images are optimized via Shopify CDN
- Add to cart uses Hydrogen's CartForm for optimal performance
- SEO meta tags are dynamic per offer
