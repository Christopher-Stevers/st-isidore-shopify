# ðŸš€ Offer Config System Guide

## Overview

The Offer Config System is a comprehensive deployment pipeline that automates the creation and management of marketing campaigns across multiple platforms. It takes a single configuration file and generates everything needed to launch a complete marketing campaign.

## System Architecture

```
Input: offerConfig.ts + AdSet_Template.csv
  â†“
Processing Pipeline:
  â”œâ”€â”€ Shopify Integration (Product + Metafields)
  â”œâ”€â”€ AdSet Processing (3 ad types per AdSet)
  â””â”€â”€ Output Generation
  â†“
Output: Ready-to-deploy campaign assets
```

## Core Components

### 1. **Offer Configuration** (`config.ts`)
The central configuration file that defines all campaign parameters.

### 2. **AdSet Template** (`AdSet_Template.csv`)
A single CSV file containing all AdSets for the campaign.

### 3. **Deployment Script** (`offer-deploy.ts`)
The main orchestration script that processes everything.

## File Structure

```
scripts/campaigns/
â”œâ”€â”€ [campaign-name]/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.ts                    # Main offer configuration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ adsets/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ AdSet_Template.csv       # AdSet definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ OFFER_CONFIG_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md     # This guide
â””â”€â”€ CHATGPT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md       # ChatGPT generation template
```

## How It Works

### Step 1: Configuration
- Define your offer in `config.ts`
- Create AdSets in `AdSet_Template.csv`
- Run deployment script

### Step 2: Processing
- **Shopify**: Creates/updates product with metafields
- **AdSets**: Generates 3 ad types per AdSet (Carousel, Video, Static)
- **Output**: Single consolidated CSV ready for Meta Ads Manager

### Step 3: Deployment
- Upload consolidated CSV to Meta Ads Manager
- Campaign is ready to launch
