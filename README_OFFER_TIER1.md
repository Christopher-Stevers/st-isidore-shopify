# Tier 1 Offer Implementation - Fall Family Beef Sampler

This document describes the implementation of dynamic offer pages in the Hydrogen storefront.

## Overview

The offer system allows you to create special landing pages for marketing campaigns that showcase products with custom messaging, pricing, and timeline information using Shopify product metafields.

## Architecture

### Routes
- **`app/routes/offers.$handle.tsx`**: Dynamic route for offer pages
  - Accessible at `/offers/[product-handle]`
  - Example: `/offers/fall-family-beef-sampler`

### Components
- **`app/components/offer/OfferHero.tsx`**: Hero section with image, title, pricing, and CTA
- **`app/components/offer/OfferDetails.tsx`**: Detailed information, highlights, and trust badges

### GraphQL
- **`app/lib/offerQuery.ts`**: Query for fetching product data with offer metafields

## Shopify Setup

### Required Metafields

Set up the following custom metafields in your Shopify admin for products that will be used as offers:

| Namespace | Key | Type | Description |
