    text: `Our cattle are 100% grassfed and grass-finished. The cows care for their calves for the first 6 months of their lives. After that, they are fed a diet of pasture, baleage( fermented grass ) and hay. We use no hormones or antibiotics. We believe that the best way to raise a cow is to let it live a happy life.`,
