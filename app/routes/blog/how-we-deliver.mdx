### Shipping Range

We deliver to all of the GTHA as well as a wide swath of Southern Ontario. If you are unsure if we deliver to your area, please check the map above or [contact us](/contact).

### Keeping it Cold

All our orders are delivered in recyclable insulated boxes designed for shipping meat and other perishable items. Since its delivered via an food courier service within the day, the meat is still frozen when it arrives at your doorstep. We recommend that you transfer the meat to your freezer as soon as you receive it. If there is slight defrosting in your box, you can still refreeze the meat without any risk as long as it is still cold to the touch. If you have any concerns about your order, please [contact us](/contact) and we will be happy to assist you.
