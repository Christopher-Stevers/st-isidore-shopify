          Cooking Grassfed Beef
        </h1>
        <ul className="md:col-span-3 text-lg flex flex-col gap-4">
          <li>
            Avoid overcooking, grass finished beef is leaner than grain-finished
            beef so it is more susceptible to overcooking. This beef is best
            when rare to medium rare. If you like well done beef, cook your
            grass finished beef at very low temperatures in a sauce to add
            moisture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Never use a fork to turn your beef. . . precious juices will be
            lost. Always use tongs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let the beef sit covered and in a warm place for 8 to 10 minutes
            after removing from heat to let the juices redistribute.
          </li>
          <li>
            Grass finished beef has high protein and low fat levels. The beef
            will usually require 30% less cooking time and will continue to cook
            when removed from heat. For this reason, remove the beef from your
            heat source 10 degrees before it reaches the desired temperature.
          </li>
          <li>
            Always pre-heat your oven, pan or grill before cooking grass
            finished beef.
          </li>
          <li>
            Marinating is recommended especially for lean cuts like NY Strip and
            Sirloin Steak. Choose a recipe that doesn&apos;t mask the delicate
            flavor of grass finished beef but enhances the moisture content. A
            favorite marinade using lemon, vinegar, wine, beer or bourbon is a
            great choice. Another option is a favourite Italian salad dressing.
          </li>
